Noble Framework

The Noble (No Bull****) PHP Framework is a simple framework I've been using for my own projects
because I disliked all the unneccesary bloat and complications from other frameworks I was using. 

This framework offers no thrills, no magic and doesnt do any of your work for you. 
Its a straight foward organization for standard apps and offers a few lightweight libraries
as helpers to assist you in building your applications. 

To see this framework working, clone the repo and take a look at the todo list app.
